# Preface {.unnumbered}

I’d like to sincerely thank my advisor, James Lowry, for his patience throughout the completion of this project. Additionally, a shout out to my family for their unwavering support, love, and encouragement during a difficult period when I had to pause my work. Their motivation helped me get back on track and see this project through to the end.

There’s a vast world to explore in qualitative analysis, especially using R, and while this marks the end of my capstone, it’s just the beginning of my journey to deepen these skills and share this knowledge so others can recreate and build upon it.
