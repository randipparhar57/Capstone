XINTERVIEWEEX was born in Jamaica, Queens, in 1982; her parents are from
Barbados, and first landed in BedStuy Brooklyn, before moving to
Jamaica, Queens. XINTERVIEWEEX attended elementary school at Holy
Trinity Community School in Hollis, a safe space with a mix of all
different ethnicities; her transition to public school starting in sixth
grade was difficult, fights broke out almost every day, and at Jamaica
High School there was gang activity and metal detectors had to be put
in. She discusses changes in the neighborhood over time, how dangerous
it was in the early 90's, jobs she had, and places she hung out - like
the Queens Public Library on Merrick Boulevard and especially the
Colosseum Mall, where teens from all over the neighborhood would
congregate. XINTERVIEWEEX talks about cultural institutions in the
neighborhood such as the African Poetry Theater and Jamaica Center for
Arts, and how she started Art, Food \& Soul after she graduated from
college as an event where the community could showcase their talents
without having to leave the neighborhood to perform or see performances.

staged in the spring of 1968.

In part one of this interview, XINTERVIEWEEX talks about what life was
like in east Richmond Hill for a kid in the 50's and 60's. During her
childhood the area was modest single family homes with yards, full of
white families of European descent -- Polish and Irish. She describes
the different grocery stores in the area like King Kullen; her uncle had
a produce store in Richmond Hill that they would go to as well. She and
her friends would ride bikes, play stickball, and roller skate around
Richmond Hill and Kew Gardens for fun, and when she was older they would
take the bus to Jamaica Center and go shopping at Gertz or Woolworth's.
As a teenager she went to dances in the auditorium at Mary Immaculate
Hospital, go to movies at all the big theaters along Jamaica Avenue, and
get ice cream at Jahn's Ice Cream Parlor.

born in Jamaica, Queens in 1970 and lived in her family home in Jamaica
Hills until 1992. At the time, Jamaica Hills had many Greek families
because of the proximity to St.~Demetrius, but there were numerous
ethnicities and her family had an Italian and Irish background; it was
predominantly a white neighborhood until the 1980's when it became more
diverse and the families she had known were starting to move to the
suburbs. XNAMEX mentions neighborhood spots that were a part of her
childhood like Joe Austin Park, Captain Tilly Park, and the Central
Library on Merrick Boulevard, which she visited at least once a week.
She also talks about the different schools she attended in the area,

XINTERVIEWEEX is an Armenian American who was born in Turkey. In 1960 at
age 12 she and her family moved to Jamaica, Queens when her father took
a job as a priest at St.~Illuminators Armenian Apostolic church in
Manhattan. XINTERVIEWEEX describes how safe Jamaica was when she moved
there, and also the different ethnicities on 168th Street where she
lived - there were not many Armenians, but she would look out for them
at shops, and made an Armenian friend at school. School was easier in
the US compared to in Istanbul, and she later went to Jamaica High
School, which at the time was one of the best schools in the city. She
talks about the different shops and movie theaters on Jamaica Avenue in
the 1960's and going to the library on Parsons Boulevard, and what she
would do as a teenager with her friends in the area. By High School her
father had moved to St.~Sarkis Armenian Apostolic Church in Bayside, and
after a few dangerous incidents - including their house in Jamaica being
broken into - the family moved to Kew Gardens / Briarwood in 1974 where
there were more Armenians living. XINTERVIEWEEX worked as a court
interpreter for Armenian and Turkish speakers in NYC.

Center, his summer jobs, and going to Archbishop Molloy HS where he was
the only black person in his class. He also talks about discrimination

XINTERVIEWEEX continued to build his career in New York until 1989, when
he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue further professional opportunities
in the talent business. In this interview, XINTERVIEWEEX recalls his
childhood in Queens and his student days on campus, including the
Concert Committee activities that laid the foundation for his successful
career in entertainment. He recounts signing some of the biggest talents
in the business -- from Rodney Dangerfield to Madonna to Jerry Seinfeld
to Celine Dion -- and running departments at all four of the top major
agencies before founding his own. XINTERVIEWEEX reflects on the greatest
rewards of his career and where it has taken him, from Colden Auditorium
to the grandest stages in the world, while never forgetting where he
came from and his strong Queens roots.
