# Introduction {.unnumbered}

My favorite genre of books is memoirs. They feel like a portal into the past, allowing me to experience the world through the writer’s perspective. Put together a collection of memoirs, and you get a unique historical tapestry. These varied perspectives weave together a broader historical narrative, offering deep and unique insights into the past.

This interest in personal histories guided me to the Queens Memory Project, which I also participated in as an interviewee. The Queens Memory Project, which is a collaboration between Queens Public Library and Queens College, is a community archiving initiative that aims to preserve personal histories that tell the story of life in Queens, much like memoirs do for the past. These oral histories provide a deeper, more personal lens on history, capturing both the grand and everyday moments of life in Queens.

This capstone project will address the following question: What do oral histories tell us about the evolving urban experiences of residents of Jamaica, Queens? The intended audience for this project are city officials, urban planners, and public library institutions, who may benefit from its insights into how the empirical data in oral histories may be incorporated as a planning practice for informed neighborhood planning. 

The primary data for this capstone project comes from the Queens Memory Project (QMP) transcripts, specifically those related to Jamaica, NY. There are over 200 interviews in the QMP: General Collections. To narrow the scope of this capstone, as it is an exploratory project, I’ve chosen to focus on a single neighborhood: Jamaica. I selected Jamaica because it is the focus of an ongoing planning initiative, [The Jamaica Neighborhood Plan](https://www.jamaicaplan.nyc/), which is currently in development and aims to guide future community changes.
