# N Grams by Interview {.unnumbered}

Similar to the term frequency analysis, but focusing on sequences of more than one word. I examined bigrams, pairs of consecutive words. Bigrams offer additional context by capturing surrounding terms, which can reveal more context. As with the single-word analysis, I counted bigram frequencies after removing stopwords and applied TF-IDF to identify the most distinctive bigrams across the collection.
