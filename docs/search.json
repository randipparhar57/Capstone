    "text": "Preface\nI’d like to sincerely thank my advisor, James Lowry, for his patience throughout the completion of this project. Additionally, a shout out to my family for their unwavering support, love, and encouragement during a difficult period when I had to pause my work. Their motivation helped me get back on track and see this project through to the end.\nThere’s a vast world to explore in qualitative analysis, especially using R, and while this marks the end of my capstone, it’s just the beginning of my journey to deepen these skills and share this knowledge so others can recreate and build upon it.",

    "text": "My favorite genre of books is memoirs. They feel like a portal into the past, allowing me to experience the world through the writer’s perspective. Put together a collection of memoirs, and you get a unique historical tapestry. These varied perspectives weave together a broader historical narrative, offering deep and unique insights into the past.\nThis interest in personal histories guided me to the Queens Memory Project, which I also participated in as an interviewee. The Queens Memory Project, which is a collaboration between Queens Public Library and Queens College, is a community archiving initiative that aims to preserve personal histories that tell the story of life in Queens, much like memoirs do for the past. These oral histories provide a deeper, more personal lens on history, capturing both the grand and everyday moments of life in Queens.\nThis capstone project will address the following question: What do oral histories tell us about the evolving urban experiences of residents of Jamaica, Queens? The intended audience for this project are city officials, urban planners, and public library institutions, who may benefit from its insights into how the empirical data in oral histories may be incorporated as a planning practice for informed neighborhood planning.\nThe primary data for this capstone project comes from the Queens Memory Project (QMP) transcripts, specifically those related to Jamaica, NY. There are over 200 interviews in the QMP: General Collections. To narrow the scope of this capstone, as it is an exploratory project, I’ve chosen to focus on a single neighborhood: Jamaica. I selected Jamaica because it is the focus of an ongoing planning initiative, The Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, which is currently in development and aims to guide future community changes.",

At the time, Jamaica Hills had many Greek families because of the proximity to St. Demetrius, but there were numerous ethnicities and her family had an Italian and Irish background; it was predominantly a white neighborhood until the 1980’s when it became more diverse and the families she had known were starting to move to the suburbs. XNAMEX mentions neighborhood spots that were a part of her childhood like Joe Austin Park, Captain Tilly Park, and the Central Library on Merrick Boulevard, which she visited at least once a week. She also talks about the different schools she attended in the area, shopping at Gertz, May’s and later the mall on Jamaica Avenue, and how people would hang out on their stoops in the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n                                                                 21(1.5%) 19(1.4%) 18(1.3%) 18(1.3%) 16(1.2%)   mother armenian people school father      ID 80854  Frequency                              0.036 0.018 0.016 0.016 0.015   laughing boots turkish father armenian      ID 80854  TF-IDF  \n\n\n\nXINTERVIEWEEX is an Armenian American who was born in Turkey. In 1960 at age 12 she and her family moved to Jamaica, Queens when her father took a job as a priest at St. Illuminators Armenian Apostolic church in Manhattan. XINTERVIEWEEX describes how safe Jamaica was when she moved there, and also the different ethnicities on 168th Street where she lived - there were not many Armenians, but she would look out for them at shops, and made an Armenian friend at school. School was easier in the US compared to in Istanbul, and she later went to Jamaica High School, which at the time was one of the best schools in the city. She talks about the different shops and movie theaters on Jamaica Avenue in the 1960’s and going to the library on Parsons Boulevard, and what she would do as a teenager with her friends in the area. By High School her father had moved to St. Sarkis Armenian Apostolic Church in Bayside, and after a few dangerous incidents - including their house in Jamaica being broken into - the family moved to Kew Gardens / Briarwood in 1974 where there were more Armenians living.
